<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Differential</li><li>Limited-Slip Differential</li><li>Locking Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle differential market includes three main types: Open Differential, Limited-Slip Differential, and Locking Differential. Open Differential allows wheels to rotate at different speeds, ideal for smooth surfaces. Limited-Slip Differential balances traction by distributing power to the wheel with more grip, enhancing performance on uneven terrain. Locking Differential locks both wheels to rotate at the same speed, maximizing traction in off-road or extreme conditions. Each type caters to specific driving needs, from everyday use to high-performance or rugged environments.</p></p>
