<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tibial Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mobile-bearing</li><li>Fixed-bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tibial bearings market is primarily categorized into mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing types. Mobile-bearing designs allow for rotational movement between the tibial component and the bearing surface, promoting improved range of motion and reducing wear. In contrast, fixed-bearing types provide a stable surface that minimizes potential dislocation but may limit natural knee movement. Both types cater to different patient needs and surgical preferences, influencing outcomes in total knee arthroplasty and enhancing overall joint functionality.</p></p>
