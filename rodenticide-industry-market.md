<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Industry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide industry comprises two main market types: anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant rodenticides. Anticoagulant rodenticides work by inhibiting blood clotting, leading to internal bleeding and death. They are widely used due to their effectiveness and delayed action, allowing rodents to consume lethal doses. Non-anticoagulant rodenticides act through alternative mechanisms, such as disrupting the nervous system or causing hypercalcemia. They are often preferred for resistance management and faster results. Both types address rodent control needs but differ in mode of action, application, and safety considerations.</p></p>
