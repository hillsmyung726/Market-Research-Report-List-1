<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Glass Curtain Walls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unitised Type</li><li>Stick Built Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The structural glass curtain walls market is primarily divided into two types: unitised and stick-built systems. Unitised curtain walls consist of pre-fabricated panels that are assembled off-site and installed as complete units, offering speed and efficiency in construction. In contrast, stick-built systems are constructed on-site using individual components, allowing for flexibility in design but necessitating more labor and time. Both types are used in modern architecture for their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide natural light while maintaining structural integrity.</p></p>
