<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipe Bursting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Pipe Bursting System</li><li>Cable-Pull Pipe Bursting System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pipe bursting system market comprises two primary types: the hydraulic pipe bursting system and the cable-pull pipe bursting system. The hydraulic pipe bursting system utilizes high-pressure hydraulic forces to fracture existing pipes and replace them with new ones, making it suitable for various pipe materials and sizes. In contrast, the cable-pull pipe bursting system employs a cable mechanism to pull a bursting head through the existing pipe, effectively splitting it apart while installing a new pipe. Both methods offer efficient, trenchless solutions for underground pipeline replacement.</p></p>
