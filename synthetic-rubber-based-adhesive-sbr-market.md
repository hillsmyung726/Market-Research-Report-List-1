<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Rubber Based Adhesive (SBR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-Based Adhesive</li><li>Waterborne Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic rubber-based adhesives (SBR) are versatile bonding agents derived from synthetic rubber, categorized into two main types: solvent-based and waterborne adhesives. Solvent-based adhesives use organic solvents as carriers, providing strong adhesion and quick drying but often posing environmental concerns due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, waterborne adhesives utilize water as a solvent, resulting in lower VOC emissions and easier cleanup, making them more eco-friendly and safer for indoor applications. Both types serve diverse industrial and commercial applications.</p></p>
