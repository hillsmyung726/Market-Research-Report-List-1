<p><strong>The Undercounter Ice Makers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Cooled Ice Makers</li><li>Air-Cooled Ice Makers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Undercounter ice makers are divided into two primary types based on their cooling methods: water-cooled and air-cooled ice makers. Water-cooled ice makers utilize a water supply to cool the condenser, making them efficient in environments with limited air circulation.
