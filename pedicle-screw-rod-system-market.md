<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Rod System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li><li>Polyaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pedicle screw rod system market encompasses two primary types: monoaxial and polyaxial pedicle screw systems. Monoaxial systems allow for fixed positioning of the screws, providing stability for certain spinal conditions but with limited angulation adjustments. In contrast, polyaxial systems feature flexible screw heads that enable multidirectional angling, enhancing the ability to navigate complex anatomical variations and providing surgeons with greater adaptability during spinal surgeries. Both systems are integral to spinal stabilization and correction procedures.</p></p>
