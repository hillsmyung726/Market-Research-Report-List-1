<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flash Steam</li><li>Dry Steam</li><li>Binary</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal turbines market encompasses three main types: flash steam, dry steam, and binary systems. Flash steam turbines utilize high-pressure geothermal fluid, converting some of the steam to power immediately while the remaining liquid is re-injected. Dry steam turbines directly use steam from underground reservoirs, making them the simplest and most efficient. Binary systems transfer heat from geothermal fluid to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, allowing for efficient energy generation without direct emissions, thereby broadening the market appeal.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Geothermal Turbines Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Power Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Power Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal turbines market includes three main applications: dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle power stations. Dry steam plants utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines. Flash steam plants extract high-pressure hot water, allowing it to "flash" into steam for turbine operation. Binary cycle power stations use a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point to vaporize and drive turbines, allowing for lower temperature resources. These technologies harness geothermal energy for efficient electricity generation.</p></p>
