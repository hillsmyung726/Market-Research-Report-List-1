<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subretinal</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) aims to treat this progressive eye disease by delivering therapeutic genes directly to retinal cells. The subretinal market involves injections into the space beneath the retina, targeting specific cell types for direct action but requiring surgical precision. In contrast, the intravitreal market focuses on injections into the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance in the eye, providing broader distribution of therapeutic agents but potentially less targeted efficacy. Both approaches aim to restore vision and halt disease progression.</p></p>
